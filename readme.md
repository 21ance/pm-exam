# PixelMotion - Frontend Dev Exam

## About

- Converted a .PSD design file into an actual website.
- Extras:
  1.  Added basic hover effect on links and buttons.
  2.  Added basic fade animation when elements are scrolled into view.
  3.  Made the burger menu clickable and expand navigation on mobile/tablet.
- Challenges:
  1.  Unfamiliarity with .PSD files. It's the first time I've used one, also don't have Photoshop but I managed to be familiar with .PSD using GIMP and Photopea.
  2.  Exporting some image based banners (car, and the family on desktop view) includes some background objects. Might be because of my inexperience with .PSD files but I was able to edit the images and remove the background objects.
